myJPP

originally based on Java Preprocessor project
(http://code.google.com/p/pre-processor-java/)
modified by Stefano Salsano & Andrea Giancarli.


===== myJPP CONFIGURATION =====

1) download junit-xx.jar from junit.org.
2) find the ant.jar jar file in java or Eclipse installation
(tipically stored in ECLIPSE_HOM/plugins/org.apache.ant_xxxx/lib where ECLIPSE_HOME is the
eclipse installation folder).
3) add to the java build path the two libraries to resolve project's errors.


===== myJPP USAGE =====

1) generate the executable jar file javapc.jar by running the task "jar" in the build.xml script of the project
2) this tool was developed to precompile upmt source code for pc or android platform to specify the precompile 
parameters edit the global.def file:

	//#define global ANDROID True 

for android version or

	//#define global DEFAULT True 

for pc version.


3) at this point the tool can be used in 2 different ways:

+) command line:

	java -jar javapc.jar -s src -d dest [-e false|true] [-i filename] [-m comment]

	    -s Source file or directory.
	    -d Destination file or directory.
	    -e If true, export a code version with the parameters you set. Or just comment the useless code. The default is false. Setting export as false is easy to debug 		your code, because the line number of code file will not be changed after preprocessing.
	    -i Define a global definition file (this file will be loaded firstly). The default name of init file is "global.def". You can define some global variables in this file. BY DEFAULT THE PREPROCESSOR SEARCHS THE FILE IN THE SOURCE DIRECTORY (specified with -s).
	    -m Define yourself mark for comment. The default is "//". 

+) GUI:
	
	java -jar javapc.jar -g

		then specify from the gui the appropriate running parameters.
